# About Meal of Record

Meal of Record was built with a simple philosophy: **Your data should be yours, and logging should be fast and space efficient.**

## The Philosophy

Most nutrition apps are built around cloud-first databases that require constant internet connections, monthly subscriptions, and invasive tracking. Meal of Record takes a different path:

- **Local First**: Your data stays on your phone. It's faster to search, faster to log, and works in a basement or on a plane.
- **Transparent Nutrition**: We prioritize high-quality reference data (like the USDA) and give you the tools to verify and edit every macro.
- **Privacy by Design**: No accounts to create, no tracking pixels, and no selling your data. Even our cloud backups are stored in your own private NAS.

## Credits & Data Sources

- **USDA FoodData Central**: The primary source for our high-quality Reference Database.
- **Open Food Facts**: A collaborative, free, and open database of food products from around the world.
- **Material Design**: For the clean, modern interface.
