# About Meal of Record

Meal of Record was built with a simple philosophy: **your data should be yours, and logging should be fast.**

## The Philosophy

Most nutrition apps are built around cloud services that require accounts, subscriptions, and constant internet connections. Meal of Record takes a different approach:

- **Local first** — Your data stays on your phone. Searching, logging, and editing all work without an internet connection. It's faster and more reliable.
- **Transparent nutrition** — The app prioritizes high-quality reference data (primarily from the USDA) and gives you full control to verify and edit every value.
- **Privacy by design** — No accounts to create, no tracking, no data sold. Backups go to your own NAS or a file you manage yourself.

## Data Sources

- **USDA FoodData Central** — The primary source for the built-in food library, providing high-quality nutritional data for common foods.
- **Open Food Facts** — A collaborative, free, and open database of packaged food products from around the world.
