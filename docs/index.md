# Getting Started with Meal of Record

Welcome to Meal of Record! This app is designed to help you achieve your fitness goals by tracking your calories, macros, and weight over time with a focus on speed, flexibility, and data integrity and privacy.

## App Overview

Meal of Record is built to be fast, private, and reliable. Your data lives on your device, not on a remote server.

- **Flexible Recipes**: Create complex recipes or simple templates you can "dump" and edit.
- **Smart Goals**: Automatically adjust your calorie targets based on your actual weight and eating trends.
- **Data Protection**: Automatic backups to your NAS and a versioning system that keeps your history accurate even if you update food or recipe definitions.

## Workflow: Logging a Meal

The most frequent task in Meal of Record is logging what you've eaten. Here’s the standard flow:

### 1. Open Search
From the **Overview** or **Log** screen, tap the Search bar at the bottom.

### 2. Find Your Food
Type the name of the food. The app searches your local database first.
- If it's something you've had before, it will appear at the top in the **Live DB** results.
- If it's new, look in the **Reference DB** results.
- Still can't find it? Tap the **Globe icon** to search the Open Food Facts (OFF) database.

### 3. Add to Log Queue
Tap the **(+) button** on a food item to add one default serving to your **Log Queue**.
- *Tip:* If you need to enter a specific weight (e.g., 150g of chicken), tap the food item itself instead of the (+) button to open the **Quantity Edit Screen**.

### 4. Review the Log Queue
As you add items, they appear in the bar at the top of the search screen. Tap the **Down Arrow** to open the **Log Queue Screen**. Here you can see the combined impact of this meal on your daily targets.

### 5. Log It!
Once your meal is complete in the queue, tap the **Log button** (checkmark or "Log"). This commits all items to your daily log with the current timestamp.
