# Welcome to Meal of Record

Meal of Record is a calorie and macro tracker that lives entirely on your phone. It's built to be fast, flexible, and private — no accounts, no subscriptions, no cloud dependency.

## Why Meal of Record?

- **Fast** — Search, tap, log. Barcode scanning, quick-add shortcuts, and a queue system that lets you build a whole meal before committing it.
- **Private** — Your data stays on your device. Backups go to your own NAS or a file you control, never to someone else's server.
- **Flexible** — Create your own foods, build recipes, define custom serving sizes, and adjust everything to match how you actually eat.
- **Accurate** — A built-in versioning system means your past logs always reflect what you actually ate, even if you update a food's nutrition later.

## Where to Start

**Setting up goals first?** Head to [Goals & Weight Tracking](guides/goals.md) to configure your calorie targets, macros, and weight tracking. This gives you the most useful experience from day one.

**Just want to dive in?** Jump to [Your First Meal](first-meal.md) for a quick walkthrough of logging your first food entry.
