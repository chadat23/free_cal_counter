# Recipes & Templates

Recipes in Meal of Record are more than just a list of ingredients; they are powerful tools for managing your recurring meals and standard templates.

## Creating a Recipe

When you create a recipe, you define:
- **Base Ingredients**: Foods or even other recipes.
- **Portions**: How many servings the total batch makes (e.g., 12 Cookies).
- **Total Weight**: The final weight of the cooked batch. This is critical for accuracy if moisture is lost or water is added during cooking.

## Regular vs. Dumpable Recipes

The app distinguishes between two types of recipes based on how you intend to use them.

### 1. Regular Recipes (The "Cookie" Example)
Use this for items that are made exactly the same every time and eaten as a discrete unit.
- **Behavior**: When you add a cookie to your log, it stays as "1 Cookie". You can't easily change the ingredients for just that one entry.
- **Best For**: Baked goods, packaged meal prep, or standard commercial items.

### 2. Dumpable Recipes (The "Salad" Example)
Use this for templates or meals that vary slightly each time you make them.
- **Behavior**: Instead of adding the "Recipe" to your log, the app "dumps" the individual ingredients into your **Log Queue**.
- **Flexibility**: Once dumped, you can adjust the gram weight of the spinach, remove the tomatoes, or add extra dressing for that specific meal without changing the master recipe.
- **Best For**: Dynamic meals like salads, stir-fries, or "whatever is in the fridge" bowls.

## Workflow: Using the "Dump" Feature

1.  **Find the Template**: Go to the **Recipe Tab** in Search.
2.  **Slide to Dump**: Swipe the recipe to the right to reveal the **Dump button**.
3.  **Refine in the Log Queue**: Navigate to the Log Queue. You'll see each ingredient listed individually. Adjust quantities or delete items based on what you actually prepared today.
4.  **Log It**: Commit the customized meal to your day.

## Sharing Recipes (QR Codes)

You can share your recipes with other Meal of Record users without any internet connection.
- **Export**: Tap the **Share** button on a saved recipe. The app will generate one or more QR codes.
- **Import**: The recipient taps the **Scan** button when creating a new recipe. They keep their camera pointed at your screen as the app cycles through the QR code "chunks" to reassemble the data.
