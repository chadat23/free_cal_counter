# Food Edit

Where you create and modify custom foods.

## How to Get Here

- Tap **Create Food** on the Search screen
- Tap an existing custom food to edit it

## What You See

### Name and Emoji

The food's display name. As you type, the app **auto-suggests an emoji** based on the name. You can accept the suggestion or pick your own.

### Image

An optional photo for the food. The app automatically resizes images to keep things fast.

### Barcodes

You can attach one or more barcodes to the food. When you scan that barcode in the future, this food comes up automatically.

### Nutrition Entry

Two modes:

- **Per serving** — Enter macros (calories, protein, fat, carbs, fiber) for one serving of the food
- **Per 100g** — Enter macros for 100 grams of the food

### Serving Definitions

Named units with their gram weights. For example: "1 bar" = 65g, "1 tbsp" = 15g. Add as many as you like to make logging faster.

!!! tip "Math in number fields"
    All number fields on this screen accept math expressions. Handy when a nutrition label says something like "2.5 servings per container" and you need to multiply values.
