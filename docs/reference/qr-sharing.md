# QR Sharing

Share recipes with other Meal of Record users using QR codes — no internet required.

## How to Get Here

- **To share:** Open a saved recipe and tap the **Share** button in the top right corner.
- **To receive:** On the Recipe Edit screen, tap the **Scan** button.

## Sharing a Recipe (Export)

1. Open the recipe you want to share.
2. Tap **Share**. The app generates one or more QR codes containing the recipe data.
3. Show your screen to the other person.

For simple recipes, this is a single QR code. For complex recipes with many ingredients, the data is split across multiple **chunks** that auto-cycle on screen.

## Receiving a Recipe (Import / Scan)

1. Tap **Scan** on the Recipe Edit screen.
2. Point your camera at the other person's screen.
3. Keep the camera steady as the QR code chunks cycle. The app reassembles the data as each chunk is captured.
4. Once all chunks are received, the recipe and its ingredients populate the Recipe Edit screen for you to review and save.

!!! info "Multi-chunk QR codes"
    QR codes have a limited data capacity. When a recipe includes many ingredients or has an attached image, the app automatically splits the data into numbered chunks (e.g., 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3) that cycle on the sender's screen. The receiver's camera captures them in sequence.
