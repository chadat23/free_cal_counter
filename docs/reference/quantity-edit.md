# Quantity Edit

The precision screen. Control exactly how much of a food you're logging.

## How to Get Here

Tap a food's **name** (not the + button) from Search results, the Log Queue, or a logged entry on the Log screen.

## What You See

### Unit Selector

A dropdown showing all available serving sizes for the food (e.g., "1 cup", "1 piece", "100g", or custom servings). Pick the unit that matches how you're measuring.

### Quantity Field

Enter the number of units. For example, if you picked "1 cup" and ate a cup and a half, enter `1.5`.

### Live Macro Preview

As you adjust the quantity, the calorie and macro totals update in real time so you can see exactly what you'll be logging.

### Per-Serving Toggle (Recipes)

For regular recipes, you can toggle between logging by serving count and logging by weight.

## Special Entry Modes

### Macro Target Mode

Instead of entering a weight or serving count, you can switch the entry mode to a specific macro:

- **Calories** — Enter a calorie amount; the app calculates the food weight
- **Protein** — Enter grams of protein; the app calculates the food weight
- **Fat**, **Carbs**, **Fiber** — Same idea

This is the basis of the **Fill to Target** feature: figure out how much of a food you need to hit a specific number.

### Minus Container

If you're weighing food in a container, tap **Minus Container** and select a saved container. The app subtracts the container's tare weight from whatever number you enter.

## Actions

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| Change unit | Switch between serving sizes |
| Enter quantity | Set the amount (supports math expressions) |
| Switch to macro mode | Enter a target calorie/protein/fat/carbs/fiber amount |
| Minus Container | Subtract a container's weight automatically |
| Confirm | Add the item to the queue or update the logged entry |

!!! tip "Math expressions"
    Type expressions like `2.5 * 28`, `450 / 3`, or `120 + 85` directly in the quantity field. The app evaluates them for you.
