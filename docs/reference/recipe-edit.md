### Portions

How many servings the batch makes (e.g., 24 cookies, 6 bowls of soup). This is used to calculate per-serving macros when you log the recipe.

### Total Weight

The final weight of the finished batch. While typically unnecessary, can be enabling for things like soup or jerky were appreciable amounts of water can be gained or lost, or where lots of zero calorie sweeteners are added.
