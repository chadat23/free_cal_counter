## What You See

### Ingredients List

All the foods (and nested recipes) that make up this recipe, each with its quantity and serving size.

### Portions

How many servings the batch makes (e.g., 24 cookies, 6 bowls of soup). This is used to calculate per-serving macros when you log the recipe.

### Total Weight

The final weight of the finished batch. Important for cooked recipes where moisture is gained or lost — it improves the accuracy of per-gram calculations.

### Regular / Dump Toggle

Switch between **Regular** (logged as a single item) and **Dump** (ingredients logged individually). See [Recipes & Templates](../guides/recipes.md) for when to use each.
