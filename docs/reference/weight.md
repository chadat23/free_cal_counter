# Weight Screen

A simple screen for recording your daily weight.

## How to Get Here

Tap the **Weight** tab in the bottom navigation.

## What You See

A weight entry field for today, along with recent entries for context.

## Actions

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| Enter weight | Record your weight for today |
| Submit | Save the entry |

## Behavior

- **One entry per day.** If you enter a weight and then enter a different one later the same day, the newer value replaces the previous one.
- **Gaps are fine.** If you miss a day (or several), the app ignores the gap. It doesn't assume zero or interpolate — it just works with the data you give it.
- **Feeds the trend.** Your entries appear on the Overview screen's weight trend chart, where a smoothed line shows your real trajectory past daily fluctuations.
