# Search & The Log Queue

The search experience in Meal of Record is designed for high-density information and efficient navigation.

## Finding What You Need

The Search screen is divided into four primary tabs:

### 1. Text Search
The default tab. It searches your previously logged foods as well as the local Standard Foods. 
- **Subtle Indicators**: A small icon or note on a search result indicates if you've logged that specific item before.
- **OFF Integration**: If you can't find a local result, tap the **Globe** to pull data from Open Food Facts.

### 2. Barcode Search
Great for packaged foods. Scan the barcode to look it up instantly in your local data or on OFF.

### 3. Recipe Search
Find your custom recipes and templates. (See the [Recipes](recipes.md) page for more details).

## Navigation Workflow: Search vs. Log Queue

A unique part of the Meal of Record flow is the relationship between the Search results and the **Log Queue**.

### The Log Queue (Pending Items)
Think of the Log Queue as your "shopping cart" for a meal. You can add several items from different searches before committing them all to your log at once.

### Workflow: Moving Between Views

1.  **Add Items**: Rapidly tap the **(+) button** on multiple foods in the Search results. You'll see their images appear in the preview bar at the top of the screen.
2.  **Toggle Views**: 
    - Tap the **Down Arrow** in the top bar to slide down into the **Log Queue Screen**. 
    - Tap the **Up Arrow** on the Log Queue screen to slide back up to your **Search Results**.
3.  **Adjust Quantities**: While in either view, you can tap a food's icon or name to open the **Quantity Edit Screen**.
4.  **Real-Time Feedback**: Both views show a "Macro Ribbon" that updates live, showing how the pending items will affect your daily goals.

## The Log Queue Screen

In this dedicated screen, you can:
- **Slide to Delete**: Swipe a bubble to the left to remove it from the queue if you changed your mind.
- **Review Total Meal Macros**: See a specific breakdown of just the items you are about to log.
- **Finalize**: Tap **Log** to save everything to your daily record.
