The app generates one or more QR codes.</li> <li>To receive: Tap Scan when creating a new recipe. Point your camera at the other person's screen as the app cycles through QR code chunks to reassemble the recipe.</li> </ul> <p>For complex recipes with many ingredients, the data is split across multiple QR codes that auto-cycle. The receiver just keeps the camera pointed at the screen until all chunks are captured.</p> Under the Hood: Why Two Recipe Types? <p>The regular vs. dump distinction isn't just a UI convenience \u2014 it affects how your data is stored, versioned, and most importantly, how much space it takes.</p> <p>Regular recipes are stored as a single entity with a version history. When you log \"2 cookies,\" the app records a reference to that specific version of the recipe. If you later change the recipe (swap butter for oil), your past logs still reflect the original version, while new logs will reference a new version of the recip. It's imple and intuative to use, but each version takes up some additional space. Note: until you log a Regular recipe, you can make any number of edits without new versions being created (the app inteligently checks how to best handle a change).</p> <p>Dump recipes don't have this versioning overhead because they're not logged as a unit. When you dump a template, the individual ingredients are logged as separate food entries. The template itself is just a convenience for populating your queue quickly. This means dump recipes can be updated freely without accumulating storage, but your log won't show \"Lunch Salad\" \u2014 it will show each ingredient separately.</p>"},{"location":"reference/food-edit/","title":"Food Edit","text":"<p>Where you create and modify custom foods.</p>"},{"location":"reference/food-edit/#how-to-get-here","title":"How to Get Here","text":"<ul> <li>Tap Create New Food on the Food tab of the Search screen</li> <li>Tap the pencil (edit button) in the top right corner of the Quantity Edit screen / search result.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/food-edit/#what-you-see","title":"What You See","text":""},{"location":"reference/food-edit/#name-and-emoji","title":"Name and Emoji","text":"<p>The food's display name.
