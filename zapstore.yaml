name: Meal of Record
summary: Fast, private, convenient macro tracking — no accounts, no cloud, no subscriptions.

description: |
  Meal of Record is a calorie and macro tracker that lives entirely on your phone.

  **Fast** — Search, tap, log. Barcode scanning, quick-add shortcuts, and a queue system that lets you build a whole meal before committing it.

  **Smart** — Updates calorie and macro goals besed on weight and eating trends. 

  **Private** — Your data stays on your device. Backups go to your own NAS or a file you control, never to someone else's server.

  **Flexible** — Create your own foods, build recipes, define custom serving sizes, and adjust everything to match how you actually eat.

  **Accurate** — A built-in versioning system means your past logs always reflect what you actually ate, even if you update a food's nutrition later.
